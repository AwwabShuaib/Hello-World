# Hello-World
My "second" repository

Hello Everyone

My name is Awwab Shuaib, and this is actually my second repository I made.
I created the first one on the terminal(git-bash), following the instructions on coding dojo.
Unfortunately for me, their instructions started to get too confusing for me. So I decided to
use Github and try to learn from here.
